# Numerical_Processes 🤖
This repository will be implemented as a documentary site for the practical works of the course: numerical processes. The team will evaluate real research problems using the different methods learned during the semester: equations of one variable, systems of equations, and interpolation. 

## The team 👩🏻‍💻👨‍💻

We are bachelor's students in production and mechanical engineering.

### Case of study #2
A manufacturing plant produce high quality diverse biscuits, for that, the layout consists of four sublines of production: black chocolate, white chocolate, cream & cookies, and coffee references.
All the refences are done by the same four subprocesses. (Mixing, baking, cooling, packaging). The enterprise biscuit’s formula stipulates that each reference must have the same base time/1000 units in each one of them to always accomplish the best quality.

Depending on the reference a time adjusment factor is considered as following:![Image text](https://github.com/Stilanof/Numerical_Processes/blob/main/study_case2/img/adjusment%20factor.png)


The operators know the total time of production of each reference as well, but they lost the base times documentation.

The company needs a program that help the operators re-writing the base times documentation and start producing again soon.
